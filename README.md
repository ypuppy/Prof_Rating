# ProfRating 📚

A modern professor rating platform for NUS students, because let's be honest — some profs are amazing, and some... not so much.

NUS doesn't have a decent professor rating system, so I built one. Now you can finally know what you're getting into before bidding for that module.

## Why ProfRating?

- **No more blind bidding** — Check ratings before you commit your precious ModReg points
- **Real student reviews** — Honest feedback from people who actually sat through those lectures
- **Simple & clean UI** — No cluttered mess, just the info you need
- **Anonymous reviews** — Speak your mind without fear

## Features

- 🔍 **Search professors** by name
- ⭐ **View ratings** and review counts
- 📝 **Write reviews** with star ratings, module codes, and comments
- ➕ **Add professors** who aren't in the database yet
- 📱 **Responsive design** — works on desktop and mobile

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React + Vite
- Pure CSS (no frameworks, just vibes)
- Plus Jakarta Sans font

**Backend**
- FastAPI (Python)
- MongoDB
